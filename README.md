# orquestra-braket

## What is it?

`orquestra-braket` is a [Zapata](https://www.zapatacomputing.com) library holding modules for integrating [Amazon Braket supported devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-devices.html) with [Orquestra](https://www.zapatacomputing.com/orquestra/). This version supports Braket's `LocalSimlator()` and on-demand simulators.

## Installation

Even though it's intended to be used with Orquestra, `orquestra-braket` can be also used as a Python module.
To install it, make to install `orquestra-quantum` first. Then you just need to run `pip install .` from the main directory.

## Overview

`orquestra-braket` is a Python module that exposes Braket's runner and simulators as an [`orquestra`](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-quantum/blob/main/src/orquestra/quantum/api/backend.py) `CircuitRunner` and `WavefunctionSimulator`. They can be imported with:

```
from orquestra.integrations.braket.runner import BraketRunner
from orquestra.integrations.braket.simulator import braket_local_simulator
```

In addition, it interfaces with the noise models and provides converters that allow switching between `braket` circuits and those of `orquestra`.

The module can be used directly in Python or in an [Orquestra](https://www.orquestra.io) workflow.
For more details, see the [Orquestra Core docs](https://zapatacomputing.github.io/orquestra-core/index.html).

For more information regarding Orquestra and resources, please refer to the [Orquestra documentation](https://www.orquestra.io/docs).

## On Demand Simulator

In order to use Braket's `on-demand simulator`, a `boto.Session` must be created using AWS credentials. See [Boto Session](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/core/session.html) for information on creating creating a session. It highly recommended that credentials are configured in the local [AWS CLI profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-using-boto3-profiles-step-2.html). Following is an example of working with `BraketOnDemandSimulator` using credentials stored in AWS CLI profile:

```
from orquestra.integrations.braket.runner import aws_runner
from boto3 import Session

# Insert CLI profile name here
boto_session = Session(profile_name=`profile`, region_name='us-east-1')
simulator_name = "SV1"
noise_model = None
simulator = aws_runner(name = simulator_name, noise_model = noise_model, boto_session=boto_session)

```

Below is an example of finding the names of on-demand simulators:

```
from boto3 import Session
from braket.aws import AwsSession, AwsDevice

boto_session = Session(profile_name=`profile`, region_name='us-east-1')
aws_session = AwsSession(boto_session)

Simulators = AwsDevice.get_devices(types=['SIMULATOR'], aws_session)
```

## Braket QPUs

This library will allow you to access the QPUs provided by AWS Braket. The process is very similar to the `BraketOnDemandSimulator`. Here is how we can get started:

```
from orquestra.integrations.braket.runner import aws_runner

QPU_name = "IonQ Device"
s3 = "https://my-bucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
backend = aws_runner(name = QPU_name, s3_destination_folder = s3, boto_session = boto_session )
```

If you want to find the list of QPU names provided by Braket, use the following method:

```
from orquestra.integrations.braket.runner import get_QPU_names

QPU_names = get_QPU_names(boto_session)
```

After setting up the QPU, you can use the following approach to send a task to a QPU.

```
QPU_task = backend.run_and_measure(circ, n_samples)
```

Since the quantum devices are not readily accessible, the results are not returned immediately. We can monitor the status of our task by `QPU_task.state()`. You can cancel the task by `QPU.cancel()`.

The outcome of the task will be stored in a [S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You are required to have access to the bucket to retrive the results. You can find out more accessing S3 bucket [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-bucket-intro.html)
